<!--
Thanks for your interest in becoming a Kairos maintainer!

Kairos is a CNCF project. Maintainers are a leadership role with repository permissions and
are expected to uphold the CNCF and Kairos community standards.

Before you start, please read:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kairos-io/community/refs/heads/main/GOVERNANCE.md
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kairos-io/community/refs/heads/main/INTERESTED-PARTIES.md

So you'd like to become a Kairos maintainer? This is exciting for us. To preserve transparent governance, we follow the process outlined below (based on Kairos community governance).

At Kairos we take the role of maintainership very seriously and while we would be happy to get an extra pair of hands, it is important that we understand your motivations and skills.

Keep in mind that Kairos is a community-driven project. As a maintainer you will sometimes need to tackle tasks that are not top priority for any single company. If your main goal is to drive features for a company/organization, consider joining as an “Interested Party” instead:

## What maintainers do (scope of the role)

Per Kairos governance, maintainers are technical authorities for subprojects. They set direction, review/merge PRs, help prepare releases, mentor contributors/approvers, and keep their subproject healthy and well-tested.

See:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kairos-io/community/refs/heads/main/GOVERNANCE.md

## Maintainer eligibility (self-check)

These are the traits we’ll look for during the review (from the governance “Checklist before becoming a Maintainer”):

- Proficient with GitHub, YAML, Markdown, and Git
- Consistent contributions to Kairos and notable impact in at least one area/subproject
- Strong attention to detail in reviews; provides generous guidance and feedback
- Helps others troubleshoot and resolve user issues
- Understands Kairos issues/PR workflow
- Participates in Kairos community discussions
- Knowledge and interests aligned with Kairos’ project goals and design principles

## Process (who does what, and when)

### 1) Discussion & assessment (maintainers + community)

**What happens**
- The applicant opens this issue and responds to follow-up questions.
- Current maintainers (and the broader community) provide feedback about fit, scope, and readiness.
- Maintainers may propose narrowing scope to a specific subproject or starting with an “Approver” role first.

**Who does what**
- Applicant: answers questions, clarifies scope, and confirms expected time commitment.
- Maintainers: review contribution history, assess technical judgement, and confirm subproject coverage needs.

**Timing**
- The assessment period is typically **up to 4 weeks**, or earlier if maintainers reach consensus sooner.

### 2) Voting (maintainers)

**What happens**
- Kairos maintainers vote to accept (or reject) the application.

**Timing**
- Voting is typically **up to 4 weeks** from when the vote is called.

**Passing criteria**
- Current policy: at least **4 maintainer positive votes** to be accepted.

### 3) Onboarding (maintainers/admins)

If the maintainer has been accepted, the following tasks need to be done by the team (usually an admin or a delegated maintainer).

- [ ] Request personal email from applicant (needed for CNCF maintainer registry)
- [ ] Add applicant to Kairos maintainers list: https://github.com/kairos-io/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md
- [ ] Add applicant to [CNCF project maintainers](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv)
- [ ] Send an email to cncf-maintainer-changes@cncf.io and CC members@kairos.io and the applicant, requesting the person to be added as maintainer
- [ ] Grant GitHub repository access (per the role mapping in governance; typically GitHub “Maintain”)
- [ ] Blog, share on socials and celebrate!

## After onboarding: staying active (off-boarding policy)

From governance: if a role-holder hasn’t contributed for **3 months** (code, docs, issue/PR discussions, etc.), an administrator will inform the member and remove roles and GitHub permissions.
