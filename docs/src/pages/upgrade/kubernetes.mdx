# Upgrading from Kubernetes

Kairos upgrades can be driven either manually or via Kubernetes. In order to trigger upgrades, it is required to apply a Central Registration Depository (CRDÂ®) to the target cluster for the upgrade.

### Upgrading from version X to version Y with Kubernetes

To upgrade a node, it is necessary [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) to be deployed in the target cluster.

To install it, use kubectl:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller/master/manifests/system-upgrade-controller.yaml
```

To trigger an upgrade, create a plan for the `system-upgrade-controller` which refers to the image version that we want to upgrade.

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: os-upgrade
  namespace: system-upgrade
  labels:
    k3s-upgrade: server
spec:
  concurrency: 1
  # This is the version (tag) of the image.
  # The version is refered to the kairos version plus the k3s version.
  version: "v1.0.0-k3sv1.24.3-k3s1"
  nodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: kubernetes.io/hostname, operator: Exists}
  serviceAccountName: system-upgrade
  cordon: false
  drain:
    force: false
    disableEviction: true
  upgrade:
    # Here goes the image which is tied to the flavor being used.
    # Currently can pick between opensuse and alpine
    image: quay.io/kairos/kairos-opensuse
    command:
    - "/usr/sbin/suc-upgrade"
EOF
```

To check all the available versions, see the [images](https://quay.io/repository/kairos/kairos-opensuse?tab=tags) available on the container registry, corresponding to the flavor/version selected.

<Info>

Several upgrade strategies can be used with `system-upgrade-controller` which are not illustrated here in this example. For instance, it can be specified in the number of hosts which are running the upgrades, filtering by labels, and more. [Refer to the project documentation](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) on how to create efficient strategies to roll upgrades on the nodes. In the example above, the upgrades are applied to every host of the cluster, one-by-one in sequence.

</Info>

A pod should appear right after which carries on the upgrade and automatically reboots the node:

```
$ kubectl get pods -A
...
system-upgrade   apply-os-upgrade-on-kairos-with-1a1a24bcf897bd275730bdd8548-h7ffd   0/1     Creating   0          40s
```

Done! We should have all the basic to get our first cluster rolling, but there is much more we can do.

## Customize the upgrade plan

It is possible to run additional commands before the upgrade takes place into the node, consider the following example

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-script
  namespace: system-upgrade
type: Opaque
stringData:
  upgrade.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    set -e

    # custom command, for example, that injects or modifies a configuration option
    sed -i 's/something/to/g' /host/oem/99_custom.yaml
    # run the upgrade script
    /usr/sbin/suc-upgrade
---
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: custom-os-upgrade
  namespace: system-upgrade
spec:
  concurrency: 1
  # This is the version (tag) of the image.
  # The version is refered to the kairos version plus the k3s version.
  version: "v1.0.0-rc2-k3sv1.23.9-k3s1"
  nodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - { key: kubernetes.io/hostname, operator: Exists }
  serviceAccountName: system-upgrade
  cordon: false
  drain:
    force: false
    disableEviction: true
  upgrade:
    # Here goes the image which is tied to the flavor being used.
    # Currently can pick between opensuse and alpine
    image: quay.io/kairos/kairos-opensuse
    command:
      - "/bin/bash"
      - "-c"
    args:
      - bash /host/run/system-upgrade/secrets/custom-script/upgrade.sh
  secrets:
    - name: custom-script
      path: /host/run/system-upgrade/secrets/custom-script
```

## Upgrade from c3os to Kairos

If you have already a `c3os` deployment, upgrading to Kairos requires changing every instance of `c3os` to `kairos` in the config file. This can be either done manually or with Kubernetes before rolling the upgrade, consider customize the upgrade plan, for instance:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-script
  namespace: system-upgrade
type: Opaque
stringData:
  upgrade.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    set -e
    sed -i 's/c3os/kairos/g' /host/oem/99_custom.yaml
    /usr/sbin/suc-upgrade
---
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: custom-os-upgrade
  namespace: system-upgrade
spec:
  concurrency: 1
  # This is the version (tag) of the image.
  # The version is refered to the kairos version plus the k3s version.
  version: "v1.0.0-rc2-k3sv1.23.9-k3s1"
  nodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - { key: kubernetes.io/hostname, operator: Exists }
  serviceAccountName: system-upgrade
  cordon: false
  drain:
    force: false
    disableEviction: true
  upgrade:
    # Here goes the image which is tied to the flavor being used.
    # Currently can pick between opensuse and alpine
    image: quay.io/kairos/kairos-opensuse
    command:
      - "/bin/bash"
      - "-c"
    args:
      - bash /host/run/system-upgrade/secrets/custom-script/upgrade.sh
  secrets:
    - name: custom-script
      path: /host/run/system-upgrade/secrets/custom-script
```
