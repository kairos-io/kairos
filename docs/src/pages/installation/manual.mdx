# Manual installation

To install manually, follow the [quickstart](/quickstart/installation). When the QR code is prompted at the screen, you will be able to log in via SSH to the box with the password `kairos` as `kairos` user.

<Info>

**Note**: After the installation, the password login is disabled, users, and SSH keys to log in must be configured via cloud-init.

</Info>

## Installation

To start the installation, run from the console the following command:

```bash
sudo kairos-agent manual-install --device "auto" $CONFIG
```

Where the configuration can be a `cloud-init` file or a URL to it:

```yaml
#cloud-init

kairos:
  network_token: ....
# extra configuration
```

**Note**: 
- The command is disruptive and will erase any content on the drive.
- The parameter **"auto"** selects the biggest drive available in the machine.
