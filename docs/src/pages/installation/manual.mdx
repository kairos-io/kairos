To install manually, follow the [quickstart](/quickstart/installation). When the QR code is prompted at the screen, you should be able to log in via SSH to the box with the password `kairos` as `kairos` user.

**Note**: After the installation, the password login is disabled, users, and SSH keys to log in must be configured via cloud-init.
