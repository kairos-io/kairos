# Image support matrix

Kairos builds several artifacts for user convenience which are based on openSUSE, Alpine Linux and Ubuntu.

The images are pushed over quay.io, and are available for installation and upgrading.

The installable mediums part of the releases are generated with the methods described in the [automated installation reference](/installation/automated/#iso-remastering) from the images sources listed below, and the images can be used to point over for upgrades as well.

<Info>
** the `ubuntu` flavor tracks the latest available Ubuntu release (at the time of writing 22.10). the LTS flavors instead are tracking the latest LTS available in dockerhub. i.e. ubuntu-22-lts uses 22.04 as base image
