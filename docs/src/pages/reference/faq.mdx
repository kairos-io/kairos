## What is the difference of Kairos compared to Talos/Sidero Metal, and Flatcar?

Kairos is distro-agnostic by design. Currently you can pick up among Alpine, openSUSE or Ubuntu based images - but we are working on CRDs to let assemble OSes from other bases in a Kubernetes native way.

The key difference is that the OS is a distributed as a standard container - similarly how apps are distributed with container registries. You can also "docker run" locally and inspect the OS, and similarly push customizations by pointing nodes to a new image.

Kairos is also quite easy to get setup with. The p2p capabilities allows also to nodes to self-coordinates, so setting up multi-nodes cluster becomes quite cheap.

## What would be the difference between Kairos and Fedora Coreos?

Kairos is distribution agnostic. It supports openSUSE, Alpine and Ubuntu (and we plan to support Fedora, Almalinux and Rockylinux too) and k3s to automatically deploy Kubernetes ( even by self-coordinating nodes ).

It is OCI-based, and the system is based from a container image. That allows to run it also locally with "docker run" to inspect it, and as well to customize and upgrade your nodes by just pointing at it. Think at it as like as containers apps, but bootable.

## If the OS is a container, what is running the container runtime beneath?

There is no real container runtime. The container is used to construct an image internally that is then used to boot the system in an A/B fashion, so there is no overhead at all - the system being booted is actually a snapshot of the container.

## Does this let the OS "containers" install extra kernel extensions/drivers?

Every container/OS ships its own kernels and drivers in a single image, so you can customize that down the road quite easily. As every release is a standard container, you can customize just by creating your own Dockerfile and point your nodes at it - you can also use the CRDs that allows you to do that natively inside Kubernetes to automatize that process even further.

Kairos supports also supports live overlaying, but that doesn't apply to kernel modules - but that is somewhat discouraged as it introduces snowflakes in your clusters unless you have a management cluster.

## How is the P2P mesh formed? Is there an external service for discovery?

The p2p mesh is optional and uses internally libp2p - you can use your own discovery bootstrap server or use the default already baked in the library - as well you can limit and scope that only to local networks. For machines behinds a NAT nodes operate automatically as relay servers (hops) when they are detected to be capable of - you can limit that to specific nodes or to let automatic discovery handle that.
