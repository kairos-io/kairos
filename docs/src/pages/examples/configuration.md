Kairos configuration mechanism is all based on cloud-config file.

By default, `kairos` reads in lexicographic order YAML cloud-config files in the `/usr/local/cloud-config` and `/oem` directories.

For instance, after installation you should be able to see the configuration generated by the interactive-installer in the `/oem/99_custom.yaml` config file.

This mechanism can be used to set and enable persistent configuration on boot, also after deployment

## Examples

Below you will find some examples on how to use the cloud-config mechanism to enable/disable specific features.

### Enabling ZRAM on boot

Copy the following file in `/oem/100_zram.yaml` or `/usr/local/cloud-config/100_zram.yaml`:

```yaml
stages:
  boot:
    - name: "zram setup"
      commands:
        - modprobe zram
        - echo lzo > /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm
        - echo 1G > /sys/block/zram0/disksize
        - mkswap --label zram0 /dev/zram0
        - swapon --priority 100 /dev/zram0
name: "zfs setup"
```

This YAML file will run the commands on boot enabling ZRAM as swap.
