For instance, after installation it's not possible to install additional packages in the system, and any configuration change is discarded after reboot. This dramatically reduces the attack surface and the impact of malicious actors gaining access to the device. ",

It makes edge scale as repeatable and portable as driving containers. Customizing, mirroring of images, scanning vulnerabilities, gating upgrades, patching CVEs are some of the endless possibilities.  Updating nodes is just as easy as selecting a new version via Kubernetes. Each node will pull the update from your repo, installing on A/B partitions for zero-risk upgrades with failover.",
