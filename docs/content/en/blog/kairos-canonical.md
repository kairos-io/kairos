Hello Kairos community!

We are thrilled to announce that **Kairos** has been used as a key building block for a revolutionary Telco Radio Edge solution developed in collaboration with [Spectro Cloud](https://www.spectrocloud.com/) and [Canonical](https://canonical.com/). This cutting-edge solution showcases the latest advances in OpenRAN automation and distributed compute management, and took center stage at this year's Mobile World Congress.

The Telco Radio Edge solution leverages the power of Kairos, Ubuntu Pro 22.04 LTS with RT kernel, and MicroK8s CAPI provider to deliver highly distributed edge node onboarding, secure deployment, and substrate provisioning. With this innovative technology stack, weâ€™ve enabled OpenRAN o-DU service orchestration at scale, while optimizing performance, scalability, reliability, and security.

This is an exciting collaboration between the Kairos project, Spectro Cloud and Canonical to develop a solution that is highly performant, efficient, and scalable. The demos that have been presented at MWC showcase the advanced capabilities of the MicroK8s CAPI provider, and highlight the power of Kairos as a building block for distributed infrastructure substrates that can host even the most demanding modern OpenRAN o-DU, 5G UPF or AI/ML use-cases at scale.

This is a true testament to the power of open-source technologies and community collaboration, and we can't wait to see what new possibilities this partnership will bring.

Thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm for Kairos!
