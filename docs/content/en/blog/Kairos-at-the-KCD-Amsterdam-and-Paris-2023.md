We recently had the opportunity to sponsor two Kubernetes events, [KCD Amsterdam][amsterdam] and [KCD Paris][paris]. This blog post, is a summary about my personal experience attending them.

Let me start by saying, that I'm fairly new to Kubernetes and its community :wave:. I know this project is big and that there are many companies building products and services around it, or have an interest in adopting it. So, I was very curious to see what kind of people I was going to meet and understand how Kairos could help them.

Most attendees that approached us at the Kairos booths, were hearing about Kairos for the first time, and genuinely wanted to know what the project was about. I feel confidet to say this, because we didn't bring fancy prices to give away and yet most of them would happily stay with us for 5, 10 and up to 15 minutes hearing about our features and engaging in conversation.

_If you're reading this and would like to know about those cool features I'd recommend going checking out the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/), [Web UI](/docs/installation/webui/), [P2P Network](/docs/architecture/network/) and [AuroraBoot](/docs/reference/auroraboot/)_

When you're in the trenches building a product, talking to users or potential users is super valuable because it let you see first hand, what kind of issues they are trying to solve. I don't like building projects just becase they are cool, for me it's important that they make people's life easier. Some of the folks who reached to us, had clear problems in mind, and they didn't shy to make hard questions about the internals of Kairos, our project's governance and beyond. I'm very pleased to say that some of them left the booth with a smile on their face, because they might have found a good fit.

While I didn't get to see any of the talks, I'm saw some really interesting topics, some of them from fantastic organizations like CERN! However, what I did do a bit, was to speak to some of the folks in the other booths, just to see what they were up to :mag: and most important to see if there were chances our different projects could leverage each other out :raised_hands:.

Last but not least, let me thank everyone :bow: who attended our booth for your valuable time and feedback. I think every one of my colleagues will agree that we're committed to building a great product, that solves real world problems and we plan to use that feedback accordingly. We have a passion for open-source and we understand that means much more than just great engineering and best practices, it also means being there for you, the community.
