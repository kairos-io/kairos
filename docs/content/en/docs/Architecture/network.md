Optionally Kairos supports full p2p connectivity.

Nodes automatically co-ordinates themselves and bootstrap from the ground-up using a distributed ledger:

The P2P networking is used for co-ordinating and to bootstrap nodes, however, when this functionality is enabled there is also a distributed ledger accessible over the nodes that can be programmatically be accessed and used to store metadata.

Kairos can automatically set up a VPN between the nodes by using a shared secret. This also allows the nodes to automatically coordinate, discover/configure and establish a network overlay spanning across multiple regions. [Edgevpn](https://github.com/mudler/edgevpn) is used for such purpose.

The connection happens in three stages, where the discovery is driven by DHT (distributed hash table) and (multicast DNS) mDNS (which can be selectively disabled/enabled):

- Discovery
- Gossip network
- Full connectivity
