```

The Kairos configuration file allows to setup features of Kairos and system settings as well. A YAML file is used, similarly to [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) which allows to specify both in the same unique file.

## Syntax

Kairos supports a portion of the standard `cloud-init` syntax, and the extended syntax which is based on [yip](https://github.com/mudler/yip).

Examples using the extended notation for running K3s as agent or server are in [examples](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/master/examples).

For instance, to set up the DNS at the boot stage:

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
  boot:
    - name: "DNS settings"
      dns:
        path: /etc/resolv.conf
        nameservers:
          - 8.8.8.8
```

{{% alert title="Note" %}}

Kairos doesn't use [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/). [yip](https://github.com/mudler/yip) was created with the goals to be distro agnostic - indeed it doesn't bash out at all (exception is systemd configurations, where it's implied you have systemd) and can also be run on minimal Linux distros, built from scratch.

The rationale is to put us in trajectory to have very minimal requirements - indeed our cloud-init implementation doesn't have dependencies, while the original cloud-init depends on python, which makes the dependency tree grow. There is a CoreOS implementation too, which makes a general assumption on the layout of the system. This makes it less portable and wasn't fitting Kairos use-cases.

{{% /alert %}}


The extended syntax can be also used to pass-by commands via Kernel boot parameters, see examples below. 

### Test your cloud configs

Writing YAML files can be a tedious process, where syntax or intendation errors might occour.

To test your configuration, you can leverage the cloud-init commands, to test locally in a container, for instance, consider:

```bash

$ ls -liah
total 32K
38548066 drwxr-xr-x 2 mudler mudler 4.0K Nov 12 19:21 .
38548063 drwxr-xr-x 3 mudler mudler 4.0K Nov 12 19:21 ..

38553235 -rw-r--r-- 1 mudler mudler  380 Nov 12 19:21 09_services.yaml

$ docker run -ti -v $PWD:/test --entrypoint /usr/bin/elemental --rm quay.io/kairos/core-alpine cloud-init /test
INFO[2022-11-18T08:51:33Z] Starting elemental version v0.0.1

INFO[2022-11-18T08:51:33Z] Done executing stage 'default'
```

Note that by default the "default" stage is executed - which doesn't actually map to any stage, to test, for instance other stage, we can use the `--stage (-s)` option, for example for `initramfs`:

```bash
$ docker run -ti -v $PWD:/test --entrypoint /usr/bin/elemental --rm quay.io/kairos/core-alpine cloud-init -s initramfs /test
```

It is possible also to test individual file by piping them to cloud-init, consider:

```bash
cat <<EOF | docker run -i --rm --entrypoint /usr/bin/elemental quay.io/kairos/core-alpine cloud-init -s test -
#cloud-config

stages:
 test:
 - commands:
   - echo "test"
EOF

# INFO[2022-11-18T08:53:45Z] Done executing stage 'test'
```

### Using templates

Fields of cloud-init are templated and can be used to allow dynamic configuration.

Node information is retrieved by [sysinfo](https://github.com/zcalusic/sysinfo#sample-output) and is templated in the commands, file and entity fields.

This means that templating like the following is possible:

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
  foo:
  - name: "echo"
    commands:
    - echo "{{.Values.node.hostname}}"
```
And [sprig functions](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) are available.

#### Automatic Hostname at scale

Sometimes you may want to create a single `cloud-init` file for a set of machines and also make sure each node has a different hostname.

Leveraging templating, you can automate hostname generation based on the `machine ID` which is generated for each host:

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
  initramfs:
    - name: "Setup hostname"
      hostname: "node-{{ trunc 4 .MachineID }}"
```

### K3s settings

The `k3s` and the `k3s-agent` block are used to customize the environment and argument settings of K3s, consider:

{{< tabpane text=true right=true  >}}
{{% tab header="server" %}}
```yaml
k3s:
  enabled: true
  # Additional env/args for k3s server instances
  env:
    K3S_RESOLV_CONF: ""
    K3S_DATASTORE_ENDPOINT: ""
  args:
    - ...
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="agent" %}}
```yaml
k3s-agent:
  enabled: true
  # Additional env/args for k3s server instances
  env:
    K3S_RESOLV_CONF: ""
    K3S_DATASTORE_ENDPOINT: ""
  args:
    -
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

See also the [examples](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/master/examples) folder in the repository to configure K3s manually.

### Grub options

`install.grub_options` is a map of key/value GRUB options to be set in the GRUB environment after installation.

It can be used to set additional boot arguments on boot, consider to set `panic=0` as bootarg:

```yaml
#cloud-config

install:
  # See also: https://rancher.github.io/elemental-toolkit/docs/customizing/configure_grub/#grub-environment-variables
  grub_options:
    extra_cmdline: "panic=0"
```

Below a full list of all the available options:

| Variable               | Description                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| next_entry             | Set the next reboot entry                               |
| saved_entry            | Set the default boot entry                              |
| default_menu_entry     | Set the name entries on the GRUB menu                   |
| extra_active_cmdline   | Set additional boot commands when booting into active   |
| extra_passive_cmdline  | Set additional boot commands when booting into passive  |
| extra_recovery_cmdline | Set additional boot commands when booting into recovery |
| extra_cmdline          | Set additional boot commands for all entries            |
| default_fallback       | Sets default fallback logic                             |

## Kubernetes manifests

When using the `k3s` as Kubernetes distribution, it's possible to automatically deploy Helm charts or Kubernetes resources automatically after deployment, for instance to deploy fleet automatically:

```yaml
name: "Deploy fleet out of the box"
stages:
  boot:
    - name: "Copy fleet deployment files"
      files:
        - path: /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/fleet-config.yaml
          content: |
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Namespace
            metadata:
              name: cattle-system
            ---
            apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1
            kind: HelmChart
            metadata:
              name: fleet-crd
              namespace: cattle-system
            spec:
              chart: https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases/download/v0.3.8/fleet-crd-0.3.8.tgz
            ---
            apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1
            kind: HelmChart
            metadata:
              name: fleet
              namespace: cattle-system
            spec:
              chart: https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases/download/v0.3.8/fleet-0.3.8.tgz
```

## Kernel boot parameters

All the configurations can be issued via Kernel boot parameters, for instance, consider to add an user from the boot menu:

`stages.boot[0].authorized_keys.root[0]=github:mudler`

Or to either load a config url from network:

`config_url=http://...`

Usually secret gists are used to share such config files.

## Additional users

Kairos comes with the `kairos` user pre-configured, however, it is possible to configure additional users to the system via the cloud-init config mechanism

### Add a user during first-install

Consider the following example cloud-config, which adds the `testuser` user to the system with admin access:

```yaml
#cloud-config
install:
  device: /dev/sda
k3s:
  enabled: true

users:
- name: "kairos"
  passwd: "kairos"
  ssh_authorized_keys:
  - github:mudler
- name: "testuser"
  passwd: "testuser"
  ssh_authorized_keys:
  - github:mudler
  groups:
  - "admin"
```

### Add a user to an existing install

To add an user to an existing installation you can simply add a `/oem` file for the new user. For instance, consider the following:
```yaml
stages:
   initramfs:
     - name: "Set user and password"
       users:
        testuser:
          groups:
          - "admin"
          passwd: "mypassword"
          shell: /bin/bash
          homedir: "/home/testuser"
```

This configuration can be either manually copied over, or can be propagated also via Kubernetes using the system upgrade controller. See [the after-install](/docs/advanced/after-install) section for an example.

```bash
❯ ssh testuser@192.168.1.238
testuser@192.168.1.238's password:
Welcome to kairos!

Refer to https://kairos.io for documentation.
localhost:~$ sudo su -
localhost:~# whoami
root
localhost:~# exit
localhost:~$ whoami
testuser
localhost:~$
```

## P2P configuration

P2P functionalities are experimental Kairos features and disabled by default. In order to enable them, just use the `kairos` configuration block.

### `kairos.network_token`

This defines the network token used by peers to join the p2p virtual private network. You can generate it with the Kairos CLI with `kairos generate-token`. Check out [the P2P section](/docs/installation/p2p) for more instructions.

### `kairos.role`

Define a role for the node. Accepted: `worker`, `master`. Currently only one master is supported.

### `kairos.id`

Define a custom ID for the Kubernetes cluster. This can be used to create multiple clusters in the same network segment by specifying the same id across nodes with the same network token. Accepted: any string.

### `kairos.dns`

When the `kairos.dns` is set to `true` the embedded DNS is configured on the node. This allows to propagate custom records to the nodes by using the blockchain DNS server. For example, this is assuming `kairos bridge` is running in a separate terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/dns --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "Regex": "foo.bar", "Records": { "A": "2.2.2.2" } }'
```

It will add the `foo.bar` domain with `2.2.2.2` as `A` response.

Every node with DNS enabled will be able to resolve the domain after the domain is correctly announced.

You can check out the DNS in the [DNS page in the API](http://localhost:8080/dns.html), see also the [EdgeVPN docs](https://mudler.github.io/edgevpn/docs/concepts/overview/dns/).

Furthermore, it is possible to tweak the DNS server which are used to forward requests for domain listed outside, and as well, it's possible to lock down resolving only to nodes in the blockchain, by customizing the configuration file:

```yaml
#cloud-config
kairos:
  network_token: "...."
  # Enable embedded DNS See also: https://mudler.github.io/edgevpn/docs/concepts/overview/dns/
  dns: true

vpn:
  # Disable DNS forwarding
  DNSFORWARD: "false"
  # Set cache size
  DNSCACHESIZE: "200"
  # Set DNS forward server
  DNSFORWARDSERVER: "8.8.8.8:53"
```

## Stages

The `stages` key is a map that allows to execute blocks of cloud-init directives during the lifecycle of the node [stages](/docs/architecture/cloud-init).

A full example of a stage is the following:


```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   # "boot" is the stage
   boot:
     - systemd_firstboot:
         keymap: us
     - files:
        - path: /tmp/bar
          content: |
                    test
          permissions: 0777
          owner: 1000
          group: 100
       if: "[ ! -e /tmp/bar ]"
     - files:
        - path: /tmp/foo
          content: |
                    test
          permissions: 0777
          owner: 1000
          group: 100
       commands:
        - echo "test"
       modules:
       - nvidia
       environment:
         FOO: "bar"
       systctl:
         debug.exception-trace: "0"
       hostname: "foo"
       systemctl:
         enable:
         - foo
         disable:
         - bar
         start:
         - baz
         mask:
         - foobar
       authorized_keys:
          user:
          - "github:mudler"
          - "ssh-rsa ...."
       dns:
         path: /etc/resolv.conf
         nameservers:
         - 8.8.8.8
       ensure_entities:
       -  path: /etc/passwd
          entity: |
                  kind: "user"
                  username: "foo"
                  password: "pass"
                  uid: 0
                  gid: 0
                  info: "Foo!"
                  homedir: "/home/foo"
                  shell: "/bin/bash"
       delete_entities:
       -  path: /etc/passwd
          entity: |
                  kind: "user"
                  username: "foo"
                  password: "pass"
                  uid: 0
                  gid: 0
                  info: "Foo!"
                  homedir: "/home/foo"
                  shell: "/bin/bash"
      datasource:
        providers:
          - "digitalocean"
          - "aws"
          - "gcp"
        path: "/usr/local/etc"
```

Note multiple stages can be specified, to execute blocks into different stages, consider:

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
   - commands:
     - echo "hello from the boot stage"
   initramfs:
   - commands:
     - echo "hello from the boot stage"
   - commands:
     - echo "so much wow, /foo/bar bar exists!"
     if: "[ -e /foo/bar ]"
```

Below you can find a list of all the supported fields. Mind to replace with the appropriate stage you want to hook into.

### Filtering stages by node hostname

Stages can be filtered using the `node` key with a hostname value:


```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
  foo:
  - name: "echo"
    commands:
    - echo hello
    node: "the_node_hostname_here" # Node hostname

```

### Filtering stages with if statement

Stages can be skipped based on if statements:

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
  foo:
  - name: "echo"
    commands:
    - echo hello
    if: "cat /proc/cmdline | grep debug"

name: "Test yip!"
```

The expression inside the `if` will be evaluated in bash and, if specified, the stage gets executed only if the condition returns successfully (exit 0).


### `name`

A description of the stage step. Used only when printing output to console.

### `commands`

A list of arbitrary commands to run after file writes and directory creation.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup something"
       commands:
         - echo 1 > /bar
```

### `files`

A list of files to write to disk.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - files:
        - path: /tmp/bar
          content: |
                    #!/bin/sh
                    echo "test"
          permissions: 0777
          owner: 1000
          group: 100
```

### `directories`

A list of directories to be created on disk. Runs before `files`.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup folders"
       directories:
       - path: "/etc/foo"
         permissions: 0600
         owner: 0
         group: 0
```

### `dns`

A way to configure the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup dns"
       dns:
         nameservers:
         - 8.8.8.8
         - 1.1.1.1
         search:
         - foo.bar
         options:
         - ..
         path: "/etc/resolv.conf.bak"
```
### `hostname`

A string representing the machine hostname. It sets it in the running system, updates `/etc/hostname` and adds the new hostname to `/etc/hosts`.
Templates can be used to allow dynamic configuration. For example in mass-install scenario it could be needed (and easier) to specify hostnames for multiple machines from a single cloud-init config file.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup hostname"
       hostname: "node-{{ trunc 4 .MachineID }}"
```
### `sysctl`

Kernel configuration. It sets `/proc/sys/<key>` accordingly, similarly to `sysctl`.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup exception trace"
       systctl:
         debug.exception-trace: "0"
```

### `authorized_keys`

A list of SSH authorized keys that should be added for each user.
SSH keys can be obtained from GitHub user accounts by using the format github:${USERNAME}, similarly for Gitlab with gitlab:${USERNAME}.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup exception trace"
       authorized_keys:
         mudler:
         - "github:mudler"
         - "ssh-rsa: ..."
```

### `node`

If defined, the node hostname where this stage has to run, otherwise it skips the execution. The node can also be a regexp in the [Golang format](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax).

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup logging"
       node: "bastion"
```

### `users`

A map of users and user info to set. Passwords can also be encrypted.

The `users` parameter adds or modifies the specified list of users. Each user is an object which consists of the following fields. Each field is optional and of type string unless otherwise noted.
In case the user already exists, only the `password` and `ssh-authorized-keys` are evaluated. The rest of the fields are ignored.

- **name**: Required. Login name of user
- **gecos**: GECOS comment of user
- **passwd**: Hash of the password to use for this user. Unencrypted strings are supported too.
- **homedir**: User's home directory. Defaults to /home/*name*
- **no-create-home**: Boolean. Skip home directory creation.
- **primary-group**: Default group for the user. Defaults to a new group created named after the user.
- **groups**: Add user to these additional groups
- **no-user-group**: Boolean. Skip default group creation.
- **ssh-authorized-keys**: List of public SSH keys to authorize for this user
- **system**: Create the user as a system user. No home directory will be created.
- **no-log-init**: Boolean. Skip initialization of lastlog and faillog databases.
- **shell**: User's login shell.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup users"
       users: 
          bastion: 
            passwd: "strongpassword"
            homedir: "/home/foo
```

### `ensure_entities`

A `user` or a `group` in the [entity](https://github.com/mudler/entities) format to be configured in the system

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Setup users"
       ensure_entities:
       -  path: /etc/passwd
          entity: |
                  kind: "user"
                  username: "foo"
                  password: "x"
                  uid: 0
                  gid: 0

       delete_entities:
       -  path: /etc/passwd
          entity: |
                  kind: "user"
                  username: "foo"
                  password: "x"
                  uid: 0
                  gid: 0
                  info: "Foo!"

          FallbackNTP: ""
          ...
```

### `datasource`

Sets to fetch user data from the specified cloud providers. It populates
provider specific data into `/run/config` folder and the custom user data
is stored into the provided path.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Fetch cloud provider's user data"
       datasource:
         providers:

         path: "/etc/cloud-data"
```

### `layout`

Sets additional partitions on disk free space, if any, and/or expands the last
partition. All sizes are expressed in MiB only and default value of `size: 0`
means all available free space in disk. This plugin is useful to be used in
oem images where the default partitions might not suit the actual disk geometry.

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
     - name: "Repart disk"
       layout:
         device:
           # It will partition a device including the given filesystem label
           # or partition label (filesystem label matches first) or the device
           # provided in 'path'. The label check has precedence over path when
           # both are provided.
           label: "COS_RECOVERY"
           path: "/dev/sda"
         # Only last partition can be expanded and it happens after all the other
         # partitions are created. size: 0 means all available free space
         expand_partition:
           size: 4096
         add_partitions:
           - fsLabel: "COS_STATE"
             size: 8192
             # No partition label is applied if omitted
             pLabel: "state"
           - fsLabel: "COS_PERSISTENT"
             # default filesystem is ext2 if omitted
             filesystem: "ext4"
```

### `git`

```yaml
#cloud-config

stages:
   boot:
    - git:
       url: "git@gitlab.com:.....git"
       path: "/oem/cloud-config-files"
