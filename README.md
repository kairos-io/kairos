    The immutable Linux meta-distribution for edge Kubernetes.
</p>

<hr>

With Kairos you can build immutable, bootable Kubernetes and OS images for your edge devices as easily as writing a Dockerfile. Optional P2P mesh with distributed ledger automates node bootstrapping and coordination. Updating nodes is as easy as CI/CD: push a new image to your container registry and let secure, risk-free A/B atomic upgrades do the rest. Kairos is part of the Secure Edge-Native Architecture (SENA) to securely run workloads at the Edge ([whitepaper](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/files/11250843/Secure-Edge-Native-Architecture-white-paper-20240417.3.pdf)).

Kairos (formerly `c3os`) is an open-source project which brings Edge, cloud, and bare metal lifecycle OS management into the same design principles with a unified Cloud Native API.

At-a-glance:

- :bowtie: Community Driven
- :octocat: Open Source
- :lock: Linux immutable, meta-distribution
- :key: Secure
- :whale: Container-based
- :penguin: Distribution agnostic

Kairos can be used to:

- Easily spin-up a Kubernetes cluster, with the Linux distribution of your choice :penguin:
- Create your Immutable infrastructure, no more infrastructure drift! :lock:
- Manage the cluster lifecycle with Kubernetes—from building to provisioning, and upgrading :rocket:
- Create a multiple—node, a single cluster that spans up across regions :earth_africa:
