# We additionally blacklist=vc4 as certain Displays are not supported by vc4.
# As kairos main target is cloud and not graphics usage, we blacklist it to avoid
# that the HDMI output goes off due to drivers kicking during boot. vc4 is required where graphics
# or video playback is needed, which is not the case in this example here.
# A similar workaround could be applied at config.txt level, by diabling the vc4 overlay.
