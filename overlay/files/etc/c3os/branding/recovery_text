Welcome to c3os recovery mode!
p2p device recovery mode is starting.
A QR code with a generated network token will be displayed below that can be used to connect 
over with "c3os bridge --qr-code-image /path/to/image.jpg" from another machine, 
further instruction will appear on the bridge CLI to connect over via SSH.
IF the qrcode is not displaying correctly,
try booting with another vga option from the boot cmdline (e.g. vga=791).

Press any key to abort recovery. To restart the process run 'c3os recovery'.
