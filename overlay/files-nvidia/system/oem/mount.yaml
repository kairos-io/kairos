## TODO: this is a workaround
## The orin packages are writing to /usr/local, which is mounted to COS_PERSISTENT.
## We probably should run this in immucore, overlaying the /usr/local of the image to COS_PERSISTENT.
## For the time being, doing it in the cloud configs.
#
### Note: This have the consequences of everything stored inside /usr/local to go inside the "local" directory inside the partition.
###       Usually this is not the case as there is no need of subtrees, but due to how overlayfs work the workdir and uppermount needs to be in the same filesystem.
