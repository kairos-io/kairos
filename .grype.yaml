# All the kernel vulnerabilities are ignored because the real cve score is lower than critical
# grype is very aggressive and marks all of them as critical which makes no sense as there are
# vulnerabilities from 2021 not fixed yet.
# Or in some other places it just mixes the version of the kernel
# A good example is CVE-2023-38427 in Debian 12. It wrongly identifies the kernel version as 6.1.0-34-amd64
# but you can see in the debian cve database that its not affected because its has a different version
# https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-38427
# Its recommended to check the cve database of the distribution to see if the kernel is affected or not
# as grype is not always correct
# So we ignore all the kernel vulnerabilities as grype is not fully reliable
